This is my new 2D Game. In this Game You have to solve a sliding puzzle by moving pieces. This is a classic Puzzle Solving Game for now. But I will try to add more unique features in this game later. I am Creating this game to learn how to make more complex puzzle games and build something big and crazy in the future.I wanted to create a game where you will solve the puzzle to form a Image and I tried but I kept getting many bugs. You can find files of them in the repo. I will Update This Game in future to add those features.
